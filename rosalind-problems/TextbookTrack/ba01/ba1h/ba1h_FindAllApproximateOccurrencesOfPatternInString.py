We say that a k-mer Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches if there is some k-mer substring Pattern' of Text having d or fewer mismatches with Pattern, i.e., HammingDistance(Pattern, Pattern') â‰¤ d. Our observation that a DnaA box may appear with slight variations leads to the following generalization of the Pattern Matching Problem.

Approximate Pattern Matching Problem
    Find all approximate occurrences of a pattern in a string.

        Given: Strings Pattern and Text along with an integer d.

        Return: All starting positions where Pattern appears as a substring of Text with at most d mismatches.
