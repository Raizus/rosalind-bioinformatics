Two unrooted binary trees T1 and T2 having the same n labeled leaves are considered to be equivalent if there is some assignment of labels to the internal nodes of T1 and T2 so that the adjacency lists of the two trees coincide. As a result, note that T1 and T2 must have the same splits; conversely, if the two trees do not have the same splits, then they are considered distinct.

Let b(n) denote the total number of distinct unrooted binary trees having n labeled leaves.

    Given: A positive integer n (nâ‰¤1000).

    Return: The value of b(n) modulo 1,000,000.
